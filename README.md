# temp-react
This repository is to allow me to gradually rebuild my portfolio as a React application. If you want to see what I've got so far, look at https://slizbethellis.github.io/temp-react/

Also, I'm really proud of the work I did implementing the scroll-based conditional rendering of the [ScrollToTop button](https://github.com/slizbethellis/temp-react/tree/master/src/components/ScrolltoTop), so take a look at that component.
